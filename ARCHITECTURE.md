# Clean Architecture Implementation

## Overview
The codebase has been refactored to follow a clean, scalable architecture with clear separation of concerns.

## New Structure

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Directory Consolidation
- ✅ Merged duplicate layout folders (`@layouts/`, `components/layouts/`, `components/layout/`) into `shared/layouts/`
- ✅ Moved UI components from `components/ui/` to `shared/components/ui/`
- ✅ Moved blocks from `components/blocks/` to `shared/components/blocks/`

### 2. Infrastructure Layer
- ✅ Created `infrastructure/` directory
- ✅ Moved SDK/API files from `lib/sdk/` to `infrastructure/api/`
- ✅ Moved stores from `store/` to `infrastructure/storage/stores/`
- ✅ Moved config from `lib/config/` to `infrastructure/config/`
- ✅ Moved auth from `lib/auth.ts` to `infrastructure/auth/`

### 3. Shared Resources
- ✅ Created `shared/` directory structure
- ✅ Moved utilities from `lib/utils.ts` to `shared/utils/`
- ✅ Moved shared hooks from `@core/hooks/` to `shared/hooks/`

### 4. Core Domain
- ✅ Created `core/` directory for business logic
- ✅ Added domain entities for `booking`, `service`, `user`
- ✅ Created use cases for business logic (e.g., `CreateBookingUseCase`)
- ✅ Separated business rules from UI components

### 5. Import Path Updates
- ✅ Updated all import paths to use new structure
- ✅ Fixed component imports to use `@/shared/components/`
- ✅ Updated utility imports to use `@/shared/utils/`
- ✅ Updated store imports to use `@/infrastructure/storage/stores/`
- ✅ Updated TypeScript path configuration

### 6. Barrel Exports
- ✅ Created index files for clean imports
- ✅ Proper type exports from components
- ✅ Centralized exports for each layer

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Business logic is separate from UI and infrastructure
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Easy to find and modify related code
3. **Better Scalability**: New features follow established patterns
4. **Enhanced Testing**: Isolated business logic is easier to test
5. **Reduced Coupling**: Clear boundaries between layers
6. **Consistent Structure**: All features follow the same organization

## Import Examples

```typescript
// UI Components
import { Button, Card, Modal } from '@/shared/components/ui'
import { HeroBlock, CTABlock } from '@/shared/components/blocks'

// Layouts
import { DashboardLayout } from '@/shared/layouts'

// Utilities
import { cn, formatCurrency } from '@/shared/utils'

// Business Logic
import { CreateBookingUseCase } from '@/core/use-cases/booking'
import type { Booking, Service } from '@/core'

// Infrastructure
import { apiClient } from '@/infrastructure/api/client'
import { useUserStore } from '@/infrastructure/storage/stores'
```

## Next Steps

1. **Migration Testing**: Thoroughly test all features to ensure imports work correctly
2. **Documentation**: Update component documentation with new import paths  
3. **Team Training**: Brief team on new architecture patterns
4. **Gradual Enhancement**: Continue moving business logic to core domain layer
